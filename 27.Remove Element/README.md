# 🟡 Remove Element - LeetCode (Easy)  

## 📌 Problem Statement  

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` **in-place** and return the new length of the array.  

The order of elements may be changed. After modifying the array **in-place**, the first `k` elements of `nums` should contain the remaining valid elements.  

⚠️ **Do not allocate extra space** for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

## 🔹 Example  

### **Example 1:**  
```python
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3  
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_]
Explanation: Elements 2 and 2 remain, ignoring the extra values.
