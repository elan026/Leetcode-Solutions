# LeetCode 1323: Maximum 69 Number

## Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `num` consisting only of digits `6` and `9`.

You can replace at most one digit (`6` becomes `9`, and `9` becomes `6`) to get the maximum possible number.

Return the maximum number you can get after one replacement.

### Example 1:
**Input:** `num = 9669`

**Output:** `9969`

**Explanation:**
- Changing the first `6` to `9` results in 9969, which is the maximum.

### Example 2:
**Input:** `num = 9999`

**Output:** `9999`

**Explanation:**
- No change needed as it's already the maximum possible number.

### Example 3:
**Input:** `num = 669`

**Output:** `969`
