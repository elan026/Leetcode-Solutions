# 🟡 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array - LeetCode (Easy)  

## 📌 Problem Statement  

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each unique element appears only **once**. The relative order of the elements should be **kept the same**.  

After modifying the input array **in-place**, return the new length of the array.  

⚠️ **Do not allocate extra space** for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

```python
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
